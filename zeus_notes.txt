Setting up an Arsenal outside of the start area

Any and all objects that are placed can be assigned to become an Arsenal, however it is advised to go into the Singular items, then search for â€˜Supplyâ€™ in the Empty tab. This is what is used in spawn and players will usually recognize this as the Arsenal. You can then find Add Full Arsenal by either searching or finding it under the appropriate tab. There are two options, either works. Click the object you want to make an Arsenal and the players will then have to access the arsenal by using Ace Interact. After this is done you can usually remove the arsenal (so as to not be abused by those pesky players!).
